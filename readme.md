# Kickr - React Starter Template

Kickr is a React starter template designed to streamline the development of modern web applications. It leverages the power of Effect, a comprehensive TypeScript library, to handle validation, concurrency, and much more.

## Features

- **Effect**: Central to the template, Effect provides powerful abstractions for:
  - Validation and concurrency
  - Type-safe error handling
  - Observability with built-in tracing and metrics
  - Composability and reusability of code
  - Robust retry and recovery APIs
  - Immutable data structures and dependency management
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Provides a utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Iconify**: Seamlessly integrates a wide range of icons into your project.
- **TanStack Router**: Implements a file-based routing system for managing routes efficiently.
- **Unhead**: Simplifies head management for your application.
- **Vite**: Powers the development experience with fast builds and hot module replacement.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/denishsharma/kickr-react-effect-starter-template.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

4. Build for production:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

## Folder Structure

- **src/**: Contains the main application code.
  - **assets/**: Static assets like images, styles, and scripts.
  - **core/**: Core utilities and configurations.
  - **modules/**: Modular components and features.
  - **pages/**: Application pages with file-based routing.

## Why Effect?

Effect is more than just a library for validation and concurrency. It is a missing standard library for TypeScript, designed to make building applications easier and more robust. Key highlights include:

- **Maximum Type-Safety**: Ensures confidence in your code by leveraging TypeScript's full potential.
- **Built-In Tracing and Metrics**: Provides first-class support for observability, integrating seamlessly with OpenTelemetry.
- **Ease of Refactoring**: Effect's powerful abstractions make it easy to refactor your code without breaking anything.
- **Composability**: Every part of the Effect ecosystem is designed to work together, making your code more reusable and testable.
- **Incremental Adoption**: You can start using Effect in small portions of your app and expand as needed.
